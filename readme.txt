1 - Create a function called NumberIsEven that receives an int and returns true if it's even and false if its an odd number

2 - Create a function called GetRandomEvenNumber that returns a random number that is guaranteed to be an even number

3 - Create a function called GetRandomOddNumber that returns a random number that is guaranteed to be an odd number

4 - Create two integer arrays which size is set using a static constant (initially set to a value of 30). 

5 - Create a function that takes an array as a parameter and initializes the array to hold consecutive numbers in decreasing value from the size of the array to 1. Example, your array should look like this after you run that function:
myArray[] = {10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1}

6 - Use the function described in step 5 to initialize both arrays described in step 4

7 - Create a loop that replaces all odd numbers from the first array described in step 4 and stores only even numbers. Has to use your functions described in steps 1 and 2.

8 - Create a loop that replaces all even numbers from the second array described in step 4 and stores only odd numbers. Has to use your functions described in steps 1 and 3.

9 - Print the contents of each array on screen. Indicate clearly which numbers belong to each of the arrays and the slot number (array index) that each of them has.
